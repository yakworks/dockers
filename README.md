# Docker images with Makefile

This is a collection of dockerfiles for CI/CD development and which are running in our kubernetes_ cluster.

Uses Makefile whenever possible. Alos setup to keep both `arm64` (new Mac silicon) and `amd64` (Intel)
Structure follows the org/repo:version naming for tags but with directories driving the tag. \
For example the `bullseye/base` dir in this project publishes to [this docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yakworks/bullseye) as `yakworks/bullseye:base`. \

- `make bullseye/base`, `make bullseye/core`, etc... too build the base images locally. This will not push it. 
- `make bullseye/base push`, `make bullseye/jdk11 push`, etc.. will build and push the images in both amd64 and arm64 platforms
- `make bullseye/build-all` will rebuild all of them
