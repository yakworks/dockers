# Docker images with Makefile

This is a collection of dockerfiles for CI/CD development and which are running in our kubernetes_ cluster.

## Quick Start

Uses Makefile whenever possible. Also setup to keep both `arm64` (new Mac silicon) and `amd64` (Intel)
Structure follows the org/repo:version naming for tags but with directories driving the tag. \
For example the `bullseye/base` dir in this project publishes to [this docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yakworks/bullseye) as `yakworks/bullseye:base`. \

- `make bullseye/base`, `make bullseye/core`, etc... too build the base images locally. This will not push it. 
- `make bullseye/base push`, `make bullseye/jdk11 push`, etc.. will build and push the images in both amd64 and arm64 platforms
- `make bullseye.build-all` will rebuild all of them, `make bullseye.build-all push` will build and push
- `make bulder.build-all` will rebuild all of them, `make bullseye.build-all push` will build and push.
  the java ones will only support amd64 platform

## Heredity

The two main workhorses are __builder__ and __bullseye__, and then the rest are special-purpose images we keep. Each of these has several builds inside, maintaining a family tree of sorts.

Builder is based on Alpine. Bullseye is based on Debian. Each has a `base` directory which directly depends on the official distribution image. From there, the other subfolders depend either on the base or on some other subfolder within the main distro folder.

The `core` folder is the main workhorse for each distro. It has the tools we use most.
